Requirements:
	1. Python/3.6 or above 
	2. jupyter notebook
	(Anaconda has been Installed in this computer that already has both)

Steps to Run RealWorld Experiments:
	1. Launch start/Anaconda/Powershell Prompt Terminal - 
	 	a) In Terminal change directory to D:/Machine Learning 
                b) run 'jupyter notebook', it will open window in explorer
			- Goto to ECAI_FInalCode/RWData_Experiments
                        - Open demo_RW_DataSet.ipynb
		 

 Steps to Run Synthetic Experiments:
	1. Launch start/Anaconda/Powershell Prompt Terminal
		a) In terminal goto D:/Machine Learning/ECAI_FinalCode/SyntheticData_Experiments
		b) Run code 'python main_CATE.py' to generate data for Figure 2 in paper
		c) Run code 'python main_correlation.py' to generate data for Figure 3 in paper
		d) Run code 'python main_kz.py' to generate data for Figure 4 in paper
		e) Run code 'python plotting' to get the plots
